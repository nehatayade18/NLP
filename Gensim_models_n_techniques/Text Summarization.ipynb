    "The running time is not only dependent on the size of the dataset. For example, summarizing “The Matrix” synopsis (about 36,000 characters) takes about 3.1 seconds, while summarizing 35,000 characters of this book takes about 8.5 seconds. So the former is more than twice as fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason for this difference in running times is the data structure that is used. The algorithm represents the data using a graph, where vertices (nodes) are sentences, and then constructs weighted edges between the vertices that represent how the sentences relate to each other. This means that every piece of text will have a different graph, thus making the running times different. The size of this data structure is quadratic in the worst case (the worst case is when each vertex has an edge to every other vertex).\n",
